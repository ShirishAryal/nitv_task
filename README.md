# nitv_task
This project uses newsapi api to fetch data show it to the UI and in case of error we fetch data from local storage (Hive is used) if available, otherwise we can try to fetch data again. 

## Usage
Get packages using

```flutter pub get```

And run hiveadapter build using 

```flutter packages pub run build_runner build  --delete-conflicting-outputs```

Just run the project now..
